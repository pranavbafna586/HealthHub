            <p>
                Ashtanga Yoga is a dynamic and physically demanding style of yoga that involves a specific sequence of postures. 
                The practice synchronizes movement with breath, creating a flowing and meditative practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ashtanga Yoga consists of six series of asanas, and practitioners progress from one series to the next as they master the previous one.
            </p>
            <p>
                This style of yoga is known for its emphasis on strength, flexibility, and endurance. It also helps in purifying the body and calming the mind.
