            <dt onclick="toggleAnswer('q1')">Q: What is health insurance?</dt>
            <dd id="q1" style="display: none;">Health insurance is a type of coverage that pays for medical and surgical expenses incurred by the insured. It can also provide coverage for other types of health-related expenses, such as prescription drugs, preventive care, and mental health services.</dd>
    
            <dt onclick="toggleAnswer('q2')">Q: Why is health insurance necessary?</dt>
            <dd id="q2" style="display: none;">Health insurance is necessary for several reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial Protection: It helps protect individuals and families from high and unexpected medical costs.</li>
                    <li>Access to Healthcare: Health insurance increases access to a wide range of medical services.</li>
                    <li>Preventive Care: Many health insurance plans cover preventive services at no extra cost.</li>
                    <li>Legal Requirement: In some places, having health insurance is a legal requirement.</li>
                    <li>Failing to have coverage may result in penalties.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt onclick="toggleAnswer('q3')">Q: How does health insurance work? </dt>
            <dd id="q3" style="display: none;"> Health insurance typically involves paying a regular premium to an insurance company. In return, the insurance company covers a portion of the insured person's medical expenses. The individual may also be responsible for certain out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance.

            </dd>
            <dt onclick="toggleAnswer('q4')">Q: What does health insurance cover?
            </dt>
            <dd id="q4" style="display: none;">  The coverage provided by health insurance can vary, but it often includes:

                Hospitalization: Inpatient and outpatient services in hospitals.
                Doctor Visits: Consultations with healthcare providers.
                Prescription Drugs: Medications prescribed by doctors.
                Preventive Services: Immunizations, screenings, and check-ups.
                Emergency Care: Treatment for sudden and severe medical conditions.
                Mental Health Services: Therapy and counseling.                
            </dd>
            <dt onclick="toggleAnswer('q5')">Q: Can I choose my healthcare providers with health insurance?
            </dt>
            <dd id="q5" style="display: none;"> Many health insurance plans have networks of preferred providers. Choosing providers within the network often results in lower out-of-pocket costs. Some plans also offer coverage for out-of-network providers, but at a higher cost to the insured.
